# Next Steps - Golf Fantasy League

> **Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Backend Foundation  
> **Last Updated**: October 7, 2025

## œÄ≈∏"≈í Overview

This document outlines the immediate next steps and clarifies the division of responsibilities between you (the developer) and the AI assistant.

---

## œÄ≈∏'‚ÇØ Division of Responsibilities

### œÄ≈∏‚Ç¨‚Äì AI Assistant Will:
- Generate code for all backend and frontend files
- Create database models and migrations
- Implement API endpoints and business logic
- Write component code and styling
- Provide configuration files
- Debug and fix issues
- Suggest best practices and optimizations

### œÄ≈∏'‚Ç¨ You (Developer) Will:
- Review and approve code changes
- Test endpoints and features manually
- Provide the Golf API key in environment variables
- Run terminal commands (migrations, installs, etc.)
- Make final decisions on design/architecture changes
- Test the application in real browsers
- Deploy to production servers
- Manually create the first admin user in the database

---

## Œ≤≈ì‚Ä¶ Immediate Action Items

### Step 1: Environment Setup (You)
```bash
# 1. Ensure you have the Golf API key ready
# You mentioned you already have this! Œ≤≈ì‚Ä¶

# 2. Create .env file with your API key
# The AI will generate .env.example, you'll copy and add real values
```

### Step 2: Project Structure Creation (AI)
The AI will create:
- [ ] Complete directory structure
- [ ] `.env.example` template
- [ ] `docker-compose.yml` for PostgreSQL
- [ ] Backend `requirements.txt`
- [ ] Frontend `package.json`
- [ ] Git `.gitignore` files

### Step 3: Backend Foundation (AI + You)

**AI Creates:**
- [ ] FastAPI app structure (`backend/app/main.py`)
- [ ] Configuration module (`backend/app/config.py`)
- [ ] Database setup (`backend/app/database.py`)
- [ ] All SQLAlchemy models
- [ ] Alembic configuration
- [ ] Initial database migration

**You Run:**
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
alembic upgrade head
```

### Step 4: Authentication System (AI + You)

**AI Implements:**
- [ ] User model with approval fields
- [ ] Signup endpoint (`POST /api/auth/signup`)
- [ ] Login endpoint (`POST /api/auth/login`)
- [ ] JWT utilities
- [ ] Auth dependencies (`get_current_user`, `require_admin`)

**You Test:**
```bash
# Start the server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Test signup
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@test.com","username":"test","password":"test123"}'

# Manually approve user in database
# Then test login
```

### Step 5: Admin System (AI + You)

**AI Implements:**
- [ ] Admin user management endpoints
- [ ] Admin middleware/dependencies

**You Do:**
```sql
-- Manually set first user as admin in database
UPDATE users SET is_admin = TRUE, is_approved = TRUE WHERE email = 'your@email.com';
```

---

## üéØ Current Sprint Goal

**Get to this milestone:**
A working backend where:
1. Users can sign up and login
2. Admins can approve users
3. Historical tournament data is imported
4. Authentication is secure and tested

**After This Sprint:**
We'll move to Phase 2 (League Management) where users can create/join leagues.

## œÄ≈∏'' Best Practices for Working Together

### Communication Protocol

1. **Starting a Task**
   - You: "Let's implement [feature name]"
   - AI: Reviews plan, asks clarifying questions if needed, then implements

2. **Testing a Feature**
   - AI: Provides code and testing instructions
   - You: Run tests and report results
   - AI: Fixes any issues you find

3. **Making Changes**
   - Be specific: "Change the team_size default from 4 to 6"
   - Reference files: "In `backend/app/models/league.py`..."
   - AI will make precise changes

### When to Ask the AI

Œ≤≈ì‚Ä¶ **Do ask for:**
- Complete file implementations
- Bug fixes and debugging help
- Code explanations
- Alternative approaches
- Best practice recommendations
- SQL queries for testing
- Example curl commands
- Documentation

‚ùå **Don't need to ask for:**
- Permission to create files (just tell AI what you need)
- Whether something is possible (AI will tell you if not)
- Approval on implementation details (AI follows the plan)

### File Organization

The AI will:
- Always follow the structure in `.cursorrules`
- Create files in the correct directories
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Add appropriate comments
- Follow Python/TypeScript best practices

---

## œÄ≈∏≈°‚Ç¨ Starting Command

Ready to begin? Say:

**"Let's start Phase 1. Create the complete backend project structure with all configuration files, then implement the database models."**

The AI will:
1. Create all directories
2. Generate `requirements.txt`
3. Create `docker-compose.yml`
4. Write all SQLAlchemy models
5. Set up Alembic
6. Create initial migration
7. Provide you with setup instructions

---

## œÄ≈∏"‚Äû Handoff Protocol

If you need to stop and resume later:

1. **Ending a Session**
   - AI will summarize what was completed
   - AI will note any pending tasks
   - Everything is documented in git commits

2. **Resuming a Session**
   - Say: "Check the current project status and continue where we left off"
   - New AI agent will read:
     - `.cursorrules` (project conventions)
     - `README.md` (project overview)
     - `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (full plan)
     - `NEXT_STEPS.md` (this file with progress)
     - Recent git commits
   - New agent will pick up seamlessly

## œÄ≈∏"≈æ Getting Help

If you get stuck:

1. **Check documentation first**
   - `.cursorrules` - coding standards
   - `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - feature details
   - API docs - https://freewebapi.com/sports-apis/golf-api/

2. **Ask the AI**
   - Describe the error/issue
   - Share relevant error messages
   - AI will debug and provide solutions

3. **Common Issues**
   - Database connection: Check `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`
   - API errors: Verify `GOLF_API_KEY` is correct
   - Import errors: Make sure virtual environment is activated
   - CORS issues: Check frontend URL in CORS config
