# Next Steps - Golf Fantasy League

> Last Updated: October 10, 2025
> Current Phase: Phase 3.5 Complete → Ready for Phase 4 (Frontend)

## Progress

### Phase 1: Backend Foundation - COMPLETE

**Completed:**
- Backend project structure
- PostgreSQL database with all tables (includes Tournament, Player, League, Team models)
- JWT authentication system with bcrypt password hashing
- Three-tier permission system (user/league_admin/owner/primary_owner)
- User management API endpoints (signup, login, admin controls)
- Primary owner auto-detection (hybrid: first user + email check)
- API tested and working at http://localhost:8000/docs

### Phase 2: Golf API & League Management - COMPLETE

**Completed:**
- Golf API service integration (Live Golf Data via RapidAPI)
- API endpoints discovered and tested: `/schedule`, `/tournament`, `/leaderboard`
- Tournament import endpoint (`POST /api/tournaments/import`)
- Tournament list endpoint (`GET /api/tournaments`)
- League CRUD endpoints (create, list, join via invite code)
- Team roster management (create team, add/remove players)
- Player draft system with league-wide uniqueness check
- API Reference documentation (`backend/API_REFERENCE.md`)

**Key Findings:**
- Scores are ONLY available via `/leaderboard` endpoint (requires orgId=1)
- `/tournament` endpoint provides player field but NO scores
- Score format: string like "-12", "+3", "E" (needs conversion for calculations)
- tournId format: strings like "016", "475" (not integers)

### Phase 3: Scoring & Sync - COMPLETE

**Completed:**
- Score conversion utility (handles API string format like "-12", "E")
- Date parsing utility (parses MongoDB date format from API)
- Tournament status auto-detection based on dates
- Added `timezone` column to tournaments
- Tournament score sync endpoint (`POST /api/tournaments/{id}/sync-scores`)
- Scoring calculation service (calculate team totals, league standings)
- League standings endpoint (`GET /api/leagues/{id}/standings`)
- Scheduler configuration (disabled by default, 15-min interval)

**Key Features:**
- Manual score syncing via API endpoint (owner-only)
- Automatic status updates (upcoming/active/completed) based on dates
- Team scoring: sum of all player scores (lower wins)
- League standings with player breakdown

### Phase 3.5: Backend Testing - COMPLETE ✅

**Successfully Tested:**
- All 27 API endpoints working correctly
- Full authentication flow (signup, login, JWT, permissions)
- Tournament import with player field parsing
- Score syncing from `/leaderboard` endpoint
- League creation with auto-team generation
- Player drafting with validation (draft deadline, team size, uniqueness)
- Team scoring calculations (sum of player scores)
- League standings with player breakdown

**Test Results:**
- ✅ API calls: 2 total (import tournament + sync scores)
- ✅ End-to-end flow: Signup → Import → Create League → Draft → View Standings
- ✅ No errors in production test with historical data (Valspar 2024)
- ✅ Testing guide validated and corrected

### Phase 4: Frontend - NEXT

**Remaining Tasks:**
1. Next.js setup with Tailwind CSS
2. Login/Signup pages
3. Tournament list & details
4. League dashboard with live standings
5. Team management & player draft interface
6. Manual "Sync Scores" button (owner only)
7. Responsive design
8. Deploy to Vercel

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 weeks

## Quick Reference

### To Resume Development

```bash
# 1. Start Docker Desktop
# 2. Start PostgreSQL
docker-compose up -d postgres

# 3. Start backend
cd backend
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# 4. Open API docs
# http://localhost:8000/docs
```

### First Time Setup

```bash
# Generate SECRET_KEY for .env
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"

# Create database tables
cd backend
alembic upgrade head
```

### Your Accounts

- **Primary Owner**: First user to sign up (auto-assigned)
- **Database**: golf_league_db (via Docker)
- **API Key**: Stored in `.env` as GOLF_API_KEY

## Permission Levels

1. **Regular User**: Can join leagues and draft teams
2. **League Admin**: Can create and manage leagues
3. **Owner**: Can approve users and grant permissions
4. **Primary Owner**: Protected, cannot be removed

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/signup` - Register (first user = primary owner)
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Get JWT token
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Current user info

### User Management (Owner only)
- `GET /api/auth/admin/users` - List all users
- `PATCH /api/auth/admin/users/{id}/approve` - Approve user
- `PATCH /api/auth/admin/users/{id}/grant-league-admin` - Grant league admin
- `PATCH /api/auth/admin/users/{id}/grant-owner` - Grant owner privileges

More endpoints will be added in Phase 2.

## Environment Variables

Required in `.env`:
- `GOLF_API_KEY` - Your RapidAPI key for Live Golf Data API
- `GOLF_API_BASE_URL` - Set to `https://live-golf-data.p.rapidapi.com`
- `SECRET_KEY` - Generated hex string for JWT signing (use `secrets.token_hex(32)`)
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` - Backend URL for frontend (http://localhost:8000)

## Troubleshooting

**Cannot connect to database**
- Check Docker is running: `docker ps`
- Restart PostgreSQL: `docker-compose restart postgres`

**Import errors**
- Activate virtual environment: `venv\Scripts\activate`

**Config validation errors**
- Verify `.env` exists in project root
- Check all required variables are set

**Token authentication fails**
- Login again to get fresh token
- Verify SECRET_KEY hasn't changed

## Next Phase Tasks

See `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for detailed Phase 2 plan including:
- Golf API service implementation
- Tournament data models and sync
- League creation endpoints
- Team management and draft system
- Scoring calculations
